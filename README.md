# Geocach-MERN-SPA

This is a single page responsive application where people can share geocache places and tips, browse maps to look for new unexplored places.
Fully equiped with image upload and address to coordinates converter.  For this I relied on mapbox API, and included multiple markers and dynamic centring.
</br>
Site is built with mobile-first design, so all features are fully responsive.
